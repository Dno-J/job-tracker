## üì¶ Local Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Dno-J/job-tracker.git
cd job-tracker

# Create and populate env file
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run locally
uvicorn main:app --reload
````

```

---

### üî∑ Render

* Deployment configured with `render.yaml` file
* Environment variables managed via Render dashboard or in `render.yaml`
* Database: **Neon Postgres** (or SQLite for local development)
* Automatic builds & deploys triggered on every push to `main` branch

**Live App:** [job-tracker-59j1.onrender.com](https://job-tracker-59j1.onrender.com)

**Setup Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Push your latest code to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to Render"
git push origin main

# 2. Log in to https://render.com and connect your GitHub repo

# 3. Create a new Web Service on Render:
#    - Select your repo and 'main' branch
#    - Use 'Docker' or 'Python' environment (your render.yaml uses python env)
#    - Set environment variables in Render dashboard OR rely on those in render.yaml
#    - Render will auto-build and deploy your app on push

# 4. Monitor build and deployment logs in Render dashboard

# 5. Access your live app via the provided Render URL
```

---

### üü† AWS EC2

* Manual Dockerized deployment on your own **AWS EC2** instance
* Environment variables configured via `.env.ec2.template`

**Setup Commands:**

```bash
# SSH into your EC2 instance
ssh ubuntu@<your-ec2-ip>

# Clone your repo
git clone https://github.com/Dno-J/job-tracker.git
cd job-tracker

# Copy and edit env file for production settings
cp .env.ec2.template .env

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t job-tracker-app .

# Run the container, forwarding port 8000 and passing env vars
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env job-tracker-app
```

**Live App:** [http://16.171.148.202:8000](http://16.171.148.202:8000)

## üß™ Running Tests

To run the automated test suite, make sure you have all dependencies installed, then execute:

```bash
pytest
````

The Pytest suite covers:

* CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
* Security checks (authentication, authorization)
* Data export verification (CSV, PDF generation)

Tests run against an isolated SQLite database for consistency and speed.
